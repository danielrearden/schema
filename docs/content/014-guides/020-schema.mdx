## Overview

This is the Nexus schema component guide. Here you will find concepts explained and a survey of how to use the API. If you are not familiar with Nexus this is a good document to read. If you are familiar, then API Docs may be of more use to you.

## GraphQL type builders

We will now begin exploring the GraphQL schema building parts of the schema component. Having prior knowledge of GraphQL language itself will greatly help. If you are new to GraphQL you may want to read some of the resources listed below.

### Object Type

[graphql.org Object Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields)

#### Basic anatomy

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
                                      objectType({
// The singleton instance of ---------^      |
// the Nexus schema component                |
//                                           |
// A type Builder method --------------------^
                                        name: 'Foo',
// The name of this type ----------------------^
                                        definition(t) {
// The type definition block -----------^          |
// Where fields are defined                        |
//                                                 |
// Object of Object Type Field --------------------^
// Builder methods
                                          t.field('bar', {
// A field builder method ------------------^      |
// The name of this field -------------------------^
                                            type: 'Bar',
// The type of this field -------------------------^
                                            resolve(parent, args, ctx, info) {
// The method called to return a -----------^       |       |     |    |
// value for this field when queried                |       |     |    |
//                                                  |       |     |    |
// The backing data model for Foo ------------------^       |     |    |
//                                                          |     |    |
// The client arguments to this field ----------------------^     |    |
//                                                                |    |
// Contextual data for this request ------------------------------^    |
// Shared across all resolvers                                         |
//                                                                     |
// Technical detail about this request --------------------------------^
// E.g. client's query AST

// Your logic to return a value ------------> ...
// for this field
                                            },
                                          })

                                          t.string('qux')
// A scalar-type convenience builder -------^       |
//                                                  |
// No resolver means Nexus returns the -------------^
// `qux` property from the backing data model

                                        },
                                      })
```

#### Scalar fields

```ts
objectType({
  name: 'Alpha',
  definition(t) {
    t.id('a')
    t.string('b')
    t.int('c')
    t.float('d')
    t.boolean('e')
  },
})
```

```graphql
type Alpha {
  a: ID!
  b: String!
  c: Int!
  d: Float!
  e: Boolean!
}
```

#### Relational fields

```ts
objectType({
  name: 'Alpha',
  definition(t) {
    t.field('beta', {
      type: 'Beta',
      resolve() {
        return { foo: 'bar' }
      },
    })
  },
})
objectType({
  name: 'Beta',
  definition(t) {
    t.string('foo')
  },
})
```

```graphql
type Alpha {
  beta: Beta!
}

type Beta {
  foo: String!
}
```

##### Lists and nullability

The following demonstration assumes the Nexus nullability defaults.

```ts
objectType({
  name: 'Alpha',
  definition(t) {
    t.id('a')
    t.list.id('b')
    t.nullable.list.id('c')
    t.list.nullable.id('d')
    t.nullable.list.nullable.id('e')
  },
})
```

```graphql
type Alpha {
  a: ID
  b: [ID!]!
  c: [ID!]
  d: [ID]!
  e: [ID]
}
```


### Entrypoint types

### Enum type

Enum types are a scalar with a finite set of allowed values. They can be used as argument types and as field types.

[graphql.org Enumeration Types docs](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#enumeration-types)



```ts
enumType({
  name: 'Alpha',
  members: ['Zeta', 'Yolo'],
})
```

```graphql
enum Alpha {
  Zeta
  Yolo
}
```



#### Example: As argument type and field type



```ts
queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.field('anyAlpha', {
      type: 'Alpha',
      resolve(t) {
        return Math.random() > 0.1 : 'Zeta' : 'Yolo'
      }
    })
    t.field('alphas', {
      type: list('Alpha'),
      args: {
        except: arg({
          type: list(nonNull("Alpha")),
        })
      },
      resolve(_root, args) {
        return ['Zeta', 'Yolo'].filter(alpha => {
          return !args.except.includes(alpha)
        })
      }
    })
  }
})
```

```graphql
type Query {
  anyAlpha: Alpha!
  alphas(except: [Alpha!]!): [Alpha!]!
}
```




```graphql
query {
  anyAlpha
  alphas(except: ["Zeta"])
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "anyAlpha": "Zeta",
    "alphas": ["Yolo"]
  }
}
```

## Data Modelling

As the API author, there are three design tasks you will invariable perform over and over again:

1. Create data types that model logical entities and concepts in your business domain.
2. Define connections between these data types that model how logical entities and concepts relate in your business domain.
3. Define entrypoints which allow traversal into this graph of data.

This is an iterative process that can generally be seen as an finite loop wherein your team gradually refines and expands (or contracts!) the data graph as you respond to changing client app needs, business needs, and so on. Data modelling is hard work. For one thing it is a subtle art, occasionally underappreciated. There are typically multiple ways to model any one thing and competing tradeoffs that leave no obvious winner abound. If the process of data modelling itself or data modelling in GraphQL is new to you, you may find this book by [Marc-Andre Giroux](https://twitter.com/__xuorig__) helpful: [Production Ready GraphQL](https://book.productionreadygraphql.com/).

## Nullability in principle

When creating an API, especially before going to production or lifting features out of beta, thinking about if arguments and input object fields (_inputs_) should be required and if object type fields (_outputs_) should be nullable is an important design consideration. How easy your API is to consume trades for how easy it is to change and some reliability characteristics.

If inputs are optional or outputs are guaranteed then client developers will have a simpler API to deal with since making requests demands no up front configuration and handling responses presents no null cases. On the other hand, for the API developer, changing the API becomes harder since turning inputs from optional to required or making outputs go from guaranteed to nullable are breaking changes from the client's point of view.

Also, as more outputs are guaranteed, the greater the potential of the "null blast radius" can be. This is the effect where, within a schema runtime, a `null` or error received from some data source where the schema states there shall be no `null` requires propagating the `null` up the data tree until a nullable type is found (or, at root, finally error).

If you'd like to see these design considerations discussed further here are a few articles/resources you may find helpful:

## Nullability in Nexus

Nexus defaults to both inputs and outputs being nullable. This means by default your API is conservative in what it sends but flexible in what it accepts. With this approach, by default:

- You're free to defer some hard thinking about output nullability, knowing you can always change your mind later without breaking clients.
- Client developers work more to processing API responses, having to handle null conditions.
- You're forced to frontload some hard thinking about inputs, since realizing something should have been required later will require breaking clients.
- Client developers work less to satisfy minimum query requirements.
- The "null blast radius" (refer to [Nullability in Principal](#nullability-in-principle)) is reduced to zero.

There is no right or wrong answer to nullability. These are just defaults, not judgments. Understand the tradeoffs, and react to your use-case, above all.

You can override the global defaults at the per-type level or per-field level. If you find yourself writing local overrides in a majority of cases then it might mean the global defaults are a bad fit for your API. In that case you can change the global defaults.

When you make an input nullable then Nexus will alter its TypeScript type inside your resolver to have `null | undefined`. `null` is for the case that the client passed in an explicit `null` while `undefined` is for the case where the client simply did not specify the input at all.

If an arg has been given a default value, then it will be used when the client passes nothing, but since clients can still pass explicit `null`, resolvers must still handle nullability. If this surprises you then you may be interested in [#485](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/485).

### Example: Default nullability settings



```ts
queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.string('echo', {
      args: {
        message: 'String',
      },
      resolve(_root, args) {
        return args.message ?? 'nil'
      },
    })
  },
})
```

```graphql
type Query {
  echo(message: String): String
}
```



### Example: Nullability flipped at global level

```ts
makeSchema({
    nonNullDefaults: {
      input: false,
      output: false
    },
    types:[...]
})
```
```ts
queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.string('echo', {
      args: {
        message: 'String',
      },
      resolve(_root, args) {
        return args.message
      },
    })
  },
})
```

```graphql
type Query {
  echo(message: String): String!
}
```

### Example: Nullability flipped at type level

```ts
queryType({
  nonNullDefaults: {
    input: true,
    output: true,
  },
  definition(t) {
    t.string('echo', {
      args: {
        message: 'String',
      },
      resolve(_root, args) {
        return args.message
      },
    })
  },
})
```

```graphql
type Query {
  echo(message: String): String!
}
```

### Example: Nullability flipped at input and field level

```ts
queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.field('echo', {
      type: nonNull('String'),
      args: {
        message: nullable(stringArg()),
      },
      resolve(_root, args) {
        return args.message
      },
    })
  },
})
```

```graphql
type Query {
  echo(message: String): String!
}
```



### Example: Mixing levels

It is possible to use type and input/field layers together. This provides flexibility to optimize for local sections of your API that have different characteristics. For example here, a type deviates from the global default for all but but one field and its input.



```ts
queryType({
  // flip the global defaults
  nonNullDefaults: {
    input: true,
    output: true,
  },
  definition(t) {
    // ... Everything in this type uses the type-level
    // nullability config ... Except the following,
    // which effectively reverts back to what the global
    // defaults are:
    t.nonNull.string('echo', {
      args: {
        message: nonNull(stringArg()),
      },
      resolve(_root, args) {
        return args.message
      },
    })
  },
})
```

```graphql
type Query {
  echo(message: String!): String!
}
```



### Example: Args that have default values

When an arg has a default you might think that then it should be nullable to the client but non-nullable within your resolver logic. However it turns out that if the client passes an _explicit_ `null` then that is considered an actual value, and hence is not subject to being assigned the default value. Thus, and then, the resolver still can observe null from the client. If you are curious about seeing this change and/or become configurable then please refer to [#485](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/485).



```ts
queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.nonNull.string('echo', {
      args: {
        message: stringArg({
          default: 'nil via default',
        }),
      },
      resolve(_root, args) {
        const fallback = 'nil via client null'
        return args.message ?? fallback
      },
    })
  },
})
```

```graphql
type Query {
  echo(message: String = "nothing via default"): String!
}}
```




```graphql
query {
  echo1: echo
  echo2: echo(message: null)
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "echo1": "nil via default",
    "echo2": "nil via client null"
  }
}
```



## Type-safety

Nexus is designed to be nearly 100% type-safe by default. It can automatically type your resolvers args and context, but there's one thing it cannot do without your help: **knowing the types that come from your data-sources (such as your database).**

By default, Nexus will generate types based on your GraphQL schema.
However, the data that flows through your resolvers can be completely different than what your GraphQL Schema expresses.

If that's the case, you will need to tell Nexus what the shape of this data is thanks to the ***Source Types***.

[You can read more about them here](/guides/source-types).
